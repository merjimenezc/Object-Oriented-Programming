Cloning of the classic 2D arcade game developed by Namco, Dig Dug.
It will feature aspects of the game like: 
A character digging tunnels in dirt, destroying monsters.
Main character can collect food to earn points.
Monsters chasing character, 
Dropping rocks on monster.

Dig Dug is awarded with achievements and food items that yield bonus points. All achievements are based on defeating two or more enemies with a rock. 
Rocks can squash an unlimited number of enemies if Dig Dug drills under them carefully. Rocks can also squash the main character if he gets caught in their downward path. A distinctive sound and the sight of a rock shaking will alert you to move out of the way before it drops.

Characters:
Pookas – This type of enemy is small, round and red.
Fygars – These small dragons breathe fire.
Food – Fruit, vegetables will appear on the screen and reward Dig Dug with points after he has unlocked their coordinating achievements.
Rocks – Multiple rocks are present on each stage, giving Dig Dug multiple ways to take out his foes.
Dig Dug – The iconic main character.

Stage 1/Level One:
Dig Dug faces four monsters on stage one. Three Pookas and one Fygar will patrol their own individual tunnels, making it much easier for players to complete this level. You can either take out each monster one at a time, or you can use the rocks positioned overhead to destroy them. Destroying two or more enemies with a rock on stage one will give you a carrot, which is worth 400 extra points.
